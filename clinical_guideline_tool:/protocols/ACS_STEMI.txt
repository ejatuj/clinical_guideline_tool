Assessment
1.1.1
Immediately assess eligibility (irrespective of age, ethnicity or sex) for coronary reperfusion therapy (either primary percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or fibrinolysis) in people with acute ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). [2013]

1.1.2
Do not use level of consciousness after cardiac arrest caused by suspected acute STEMI to determine whether a person is eligible for coronary angiography (with follow‑on primary PCI if indicated). [2013]

1.1.3
Deliver coronary reperfusion therapy (either primary PCI or fibrinolysis) as quickly as possible for eligible people with acute STEMI. [2013]

Initial drug therapy
1.1.4
Offer people with acute STEMI a single loading dose of 300 mg aspirin as soon as possible unless there is clear evidence that they are allergic to it. [2010]

1.1.5
Do not offer routine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or fibrinolytic drugs before arrival at the catheter laboratory to people with acute STEMI for whom primary PCI is planned. [2013]

Coronary angiography with follow-on primary PCI
1.1.6
Offer coronary angiography, with follow‑on primary PCI if indicated, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy for people with acute STEMI, if:

presentation is within 12 hours of onset of symptoms and

primary PCI can be delivered within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given. [2013]

1.1.7
Offer coronary angiography, with follow‑on primary PCI if indicated, to people with acute STEMI and cardiogenic shock who present within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms of STEMI. [2013]

1.1.8
Consider coronary angiography, with follow‑on primary PCI if indicated, for people with acute STEMI presenting more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms if there is evidence of continuing myocardial ischaemia. [2013]

1.1.9
Consider coronary angiography, with a view to coronary revascularisation if indicated, for people with acute STEMI who present more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms and who have cardiogenic shock or go on to develop it. [2013]

1.1.10
Consider radial (in preference to femoral) arterial access for people undergoing coronary angiography (with follow‑on primary PCI if indicated). [2013]

Dual antiplatelet therapy for people with acute STEMI having primary PCI
1.1.11
For people with acute STEMI who are having primary PCI, offer:

prasugrel, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, if they are not already taking an oral anticoagulant (for people aged 75 and over, think about whether the person's risk of bleeding with prasugrel outweighs its effectiveness, in which case offer ticagrelor or clopidogrel as alternatives)

clopidogrel, as part of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, if they are already taking an oral anticoagulant. [2020]

Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended as options in NICE technology appraisal guidance for people with acute STEMI having primary PCI.

Antithrombin therapy during primary PCI
1.1.12
Offer unfractionated heparin with bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy to people with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI with radial access. [2020]

1.1.13
Consider bivalirudin with bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in combination with dual antiplatelet therapy for people with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI when femoral access is needed.

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.

Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines (including off‑label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.

1.1 STEMI – early management
NICE has produced a visual summary of the recommendations on the early management of STEMI.
